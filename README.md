🌟 Day 5: Solving Array Problems on LeetCode 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋 I'm excited to share the progress I made on Day 5 of my 50-day LeetCode milestone challenge. Today, I tackled two interesting problems that helped deepen my understanding of array manipulation and problem-solving techniques. Below are the details of what I tackled on Day 5.

Contents:
1. Q287. Find the Duplicate Number
    - Problem Statement: Given an array of integers `nums` containing n+1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive, there is exactly one duplicate number in `nums`. Find the duplicate number.
    - Time Complexity: 
        - O(n log n) for sorting ⏳
        - O(n) for positioning method ⏳
    - Approaches:
        - Sorting: Initially used sorting to find the duplicate, but it was not optimal as per the problem constraints.
        - Positioning Method: Treated the numbers as if they were indices. Checked if every index had the correct element, which helped identify the duplicate efficiently.
2. Find Missing Element from an Array with Duplicates
    - Problem Statement: Given an array containing duplicates, find the missing element from the range.
    - Time Complexity: O(n) ⏳
    - Approach: Iterated through the array to identify the missing element, considering the presence of duplicates.

Why This Matters:
Practicing these types of problems on LeetCode helps in developing a deeper understanding of essential algorithms and data structures, which is crucial for acing technical interviews and improving coding skills.

Repository Structure:
- `find_duplicate.cpp`: Contains the code for solving Q287. Find the Duplicate Number using both the sorting and positioning method approaches.
- `find_missing_element.cpp`: Contains the code for finding the missing element in an array with duplicates.
- `README.md`: This readme file explaining the purpose and usage of the code files.

How to Use:
- Explore the code examples in the respective files to understand the approaches used to solve these problems.
- Use these examples as a reference for your own projects and studies.
